I am currently a first-year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by [Prof. Nikolaus Correll](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/nikolaus-correll) and [Prof. Alessandro Roncone](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/alessandro-roncone).

My research focuses on building intelligent agents that can efficiently learn to understand and interact with our world. My work bridges two critical areas:
1) **Agent Learning:** Improving the generalization and sample efficiency of reinforcement learning for robotic tasks like visual navigation and manipulation.
2) **Foundational Models:** Scaling the inference of pre-trained models (e.g., Large Language and Vision-Language Models) to serve as the knowledge backbone for these agents.

Previously, I worked for 2 years as a Research Engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Prof. Jiafeng Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nD0I3PUAAAAJ&hl=en). I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, where I was advised by [Prof. Laurent Itti](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/).

      <em>International Symposium on Robotics Research (ISRR), 2024.</em><br>
      <em>Also presented at the NeurIPS 2023 Robot Learning Workshop.</em><br>
      We propose a robust system that integrates the control policy with a pretrained visual perception model and an LSTM-based world model, facilitating seamless application in real-world scenarios.
